##Point
This is a software I *will* use to run my [printing business](https://www.printuridigital.ro). Currently operations are managed by a Cake app written ten years ago.
Meantime I become experienced with various web-related technologies so, the time has came for my old Managerium to evolve into a modern, easy to mantain app.

Best news are that it is given to everyone eager to controll, monitor and profit about his business.
